               Generating builds with MPC
               
Check out the MPC module from the SubVersion repository. It's
location is

https://svn.dre.vanaderbilt.edu/DOC/MPC/trunk

Move the contents of the 'trunk' directory up to the level of
the 'trunk' directory, and delete it. Set $MPC_ROOT in your
environment to the path of this new directory. Building the
entire DDS_Test directory include building DEEP and lots
of tests and examples - most of the latter depend on ACE
and some depend on TAO. If you have ACE+TAO installed,
then, from the directory this README file is in, type

$ACE_ROOT/mwc.pl -type <type> DDSTest.mwc

where <type> is 'make' or 'vc71' or 'vc8'.

<!-- Assumptions

1) The student should create unique content filtered topic names (e.g.,
by appending the process Id). This isn't strictly needed for this assignment
since if more than one subscriber is executed each content filtered topic
will have its own domain participant. However, it seems good practice to
do this in case more than one content filtered topic is created from the
same domain participant.

2) The level of granularity for setting update and publish rates is in
milliseconds.

3) With this assignment students can start to play around with and
investigate timing and reliability especially by having the publisher
update and publish as quickly as possible and also by having multiple
publishers and subscribers and noting the effect this has on the
flow of data. However, this assignment has the publisher and subscriber
printing out values. Maybe this should be removed or maybe there is
enough interesting behavior related to timing even with these printouts.
I don't know how "realistic" we can expect the environment to be especially
if the student is running everything on the same machine.
-->

<!-- Questions
1) Should the student be expected to use C++ and STL constructs over C? For
example, the student will need to manipulate and output text. Should the
student be required to use std::string and std::cout as opposed to char*
and printf? An argument might be made that C is more efficient or faster
although this is situational and rarely the case if C++ is coded
appropriately. The nddsgen generated code is C++ but has a C feel to it
(e.g., using printf).

In this assignment, you will build on the simple NDDS Stock Quoter application
from assignment 1. With assignment 1, the subscriber was subscribing to all
the published stocks. In this assignment you will create a content filtered
topic to subscribe only to the stock symbol that the user specifies on the
command line. You will also make some changes as to how often stock prices
are updated and published.<P>


<H4>DDS IDL Specification</H4>

You will use the same IDL specification used for assignment 1 here. This
specification is shown below for convenience.

<PRE><CODE>
// IDL schema definition for Stock Quoter application.
struct Quoter
{
  double price;
  string symbol;
};
</PRE></CODE>

You can start with the publisher and subscriber executables from
assignment 1 as a baseline and modify them for this assignment.<P>

<H4>Subscriber Functionality</H4>

On the subscriber side, you'll need to add a content filtered topic so
that only the stock specified by the user on the command line is received.
As part of this you will need to modify the processing of command line
arguments so that
the desired stock symbol can be specified on the command line. You will
also need to print out a usage statement if improper arguments are used
or if the user explicitly asks for help (e.g., using the "-h" command
line argument). Be flexible with the processing of the command line
arguments. Allow the user to specify only the values of interest and
provide defaults for all the others.

You will need to make the appropriate NDDS API calls to create a
content filtered topic. Steps in doing this include creating a unique
topic name, creating the filter expression, and creating the content
filtered topic using the name and filter expression. Make sure that the
content filtered topic name is unique for each content filtered topic
that is created. This is required if the content filtered topics are
created with the same domain participant. This shouldn't be the case
for this class but it is good practice to have. Also, be sure you know
the format (or notation) needed for the values used in the filter
expression. There are examples in the <EM>Content Filtered Topics</EM>
section of the
<A HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~mxiong/RTI_DDS_UsersManual.pdf">
User Manual</A>.<P>

Your modified code should now take at least three command line parameters:
1) the domain id, 2) the number of iterations, and 3) the stock symbol
to which the subscriber should subscribe. The user should be able to specify
the stock symbol for the stock that is of interest.
<P>

<B>NOTE: The domain ids for the subscriber and the publisher must match.
Otherwise, there will be no data flowing between the two.</B><P>

If anything fails to work properly the subscriber should simply print out
the appropriate exception and exit with a return status of 1.  If
everything works correctly, the subscriber should exit with a return
status of 0 when the correct number of iterations have been executed.<P>

<H4>Publisher Functionality</H4> 

The publisher implementation generated by nddsgen has the publisher
updating stock values every 4 seconds. You will need to change the
publisher implementation so that the user can specify how often the
stock price should be updated. The user should be able to pass this
value in on the command line. The granularity used for this should be
milliseconds. That is, the user should be able to specify if
the publisher updates and publishes every 1 ms, every 2 ms, every
3 ms, etc. There should be a way for the user
to specify that the publisher update and publish values as quickly as
possible. Be flexible with the processing of the command line
arguments. Allow the user to specify only the values of interest and
provide defaults for all the others.

Your modified code should now take at least three command line parameters:
1) the domain id, 2) the number of iterations, and 3) the rate at which
the publisher should update and publish stock values.
<P>

<B>NOTE: The domain ids for the subscriber and the publisher must match.
Otherwise, there will be no data flowing between the two. By default,
the domain ids used will both be 0.</B><P>

If anything fails to work properly the publisher should simply print out
the appropriate exception and exit with a return status of 1.  If
everything works correctly, the publisher should exit with a return
status of 0 when the correct number of iterations have been executed.<P>

Unless you add new source files to the build the makefile (for Linux)
or solution (for Visual Studio) generated for
assignment 1 should work as is for assignment 2. If you've added source
files or executables then these will need to be added to the makefile
or solution as well.
<P>

The executables that are built are stand-alone and can be run from
anywhere. Also, the order in which the executables are invoked is not
important although by default the subscriber will only receive published
updates since the time it was started. Again, later, we'll see how to
change this so the subscriber can receive updates published before the
subscriber started.<P>

<H3><A name=Concluding>Concluding Remarks</A></H3>

This second DDS assignment is not very difficult but builds on the previous
assignment and adds more complex DDS concepts for implementation. It
starts to illustrate some of the DDS filtering mechanisms available.
Subsequent assignments will build on this assignment, so make sure you
get it working correctly. <P>

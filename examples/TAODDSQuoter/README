This example is a simple Stock Quoter to be used for Doug's CS 395 class.
The missing code and makefiles can be generated by using the mpc.pl Perl
script (located in $ACE_wrapper/ace/bin) on the Quoter.mpc file. The rest
of the needed code can be generated by running the generated makefiles
for the Publisher and the Subscriber. Everything should build cleanly.
Use the run_test.pl script to test the builds. The publisher should
publish 10 updates of the IBM stock and the subscriber should see these
updates and print them out.

There is currently a problem in that the publisher and subscriber need
to be run on the same machine. (The InfoRepo can be run on a different
machine just so long as all the executables are run in the same NFS
directory.) When run on different machines the publisher errors and
either hangs or seg faults.

         Simple Test Framework Example
         
   September 11, 2006
         
This example uses a simple byte sequence for a data type
and shows how a simple test can be written and run by
relying on the Test Framework library to handle most of
the implementation differences, as well as the differences
between pub and sub code.

The 4 executables built in this directory at present 
include

NDDS publisher
NDDS subscriber
TAO DDS publisher
TAO DDS subscriber

All 4 executables share the same IDL and main() driver.
This example will be added to and elaborated piecemeal
as support for additional features is added. There will
also be support added for OpenSplice, after similar
support has been added to the Test Framework library.

So far, actual communication between publisher and
subscriber has not yet been tested, but for each
implementation, the typical pub and/or sub actions:

- resolution of the domain participant factory
- participant creation
- publisher creation
- subscriber creation
- data writer creation
- data reader creation
- listener creation
- waitset creation
- implementation-specific transport configuration
- default QoS initialization of all entities
- cleanup of all entities

have been tried and found to execute successfully.

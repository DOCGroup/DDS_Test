This example is a simple Stock Quoter to be used for Doug's CS 395 class.
The missing code and makefiles can be generated by using the mpc.pl Perl
script (located in $ACE_wrapper/ace/bin) on the Quoter.mpc file. The rest
of the needed code can be generated by running the generated makefiles
for the Publisher and the Subscriber. Everything should build cleanly.
Use the run_test.pl script to test the builds. The publisher should
publish 10 updates of the IBM stock and the subscriber should see these
updates and print them out.

Please see http://www.ociweb.com/products/dds for more information on
TAO DDS and http://www.ociweb.com/products/mpc for more information on
MPC.

The following outlines how to run the executables on different machines.
The Info Repository can be started up as follows:
$DDS_ROOT/dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo -NOBITS -o repo.ior -d domain_ids

The subscriber can be started up as follows:
./subscriber -DCPSConfigFile tcp.ini

The publisher can be started up as follows:
./publisher -DCPSConfigFile tcp.ini


The output should look something like this:

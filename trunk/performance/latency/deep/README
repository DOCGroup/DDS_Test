1. Overview
-------------
RT-DEEP is a actor-based C++ framework for runnning applications compliant with
DDS specifications. Current framework supports three actors: source, sink, 
reflector. A source actor is responsible for peridocially sending out publishing data
samples. A sink actor, which usually resides in the same node with a source actor,
is responsible for receiving data from reflectors. A reflector actor, is responsible 
for receiving the data from a source and reflecting the data back to the sink. Latency
measurement can be accomplished easily with current actor settings.

3. Building RT-DEEP
-------------------

Building RT-DEEP is very straightforward, but you have to log on to blade40 as tczar
to do it at this point because blade40 has all the resources necessary for a successful
build. 

For RTI DDS DEEP

.build_OpenSplice.sh


For OpenSplice DDS DEEP

.build_RTI.sh

README
-----------------------------
   This file explains the compilation and running of testcode.
   Be sure to read it before running the test.

What is in the directory?
-----------------------------
  - Source codes for test
  - mpb files used for mpc
  - program running script ./RUN ./RUNRepo
  - README


What does the program do?
----------------------------
  The test program basically carries out synchronous hand-shake
  operation, with a publisher sending out messages with the size
  you specified along with a sequence number and a subscriber
  sending back the same sequence number as an acknowledgement.
  Note that you should keep in mind that the publisher process
  in this case is also a subscriber to the subscriber node
  (subscribe to AckMessage topic). As a result you will see in
  the code, the initialization of subscriber and publisher is 
  very complex. Check out the code for details. 


How to compile the program?
----------------------------
  Assuming that you have TAO DDS 0.6 installed (which is what i
  got from download.ociweb.com/DDS/) and the environment variables
  properly set, a mwc.pl + a make will do the job in this case.
  I copied the *.mpb in $DDS_ROOT in case the mwc.pl would complain.
  There will be warnings in the compilation, but that's for generated
  TypeSupport files. Please let me know if the warnings are related
  to my code.


How to run the program
---------------------------
  The way I run the program is
  1) open an new session/shell
  2) ./RUNRepo
  3) Back to the current session
  4) sudo ./RUN


  To run the program properly, you NEED to be the root or in the
  \sudoer list. The way i run the program is to use sudo.But what
  happens to me is that when i run the program as a ROOT, it does
  not recognize some environment variables that i set as ME. So
  I put the export stuff in the ./RUN file so that everytime the
  program is run, the environment is set up in advance. If you stay
  with the way i run the program, you may want to change them to
  suit your specific environments. 


About the test parameter
---------------------------

  In the ./RUN file, you may specify the size of the messages (in bytes)
  sent by publisher by setting the -s option for tao_pub. Two parameters
  you may want to look into is 4 and 16384. The result (average round-trip time)
  I got for these two parameters are 40838 us and 758 us respectively.
  I got similar result as 4 (byte) when i set the parameter to 8, 16,
  32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 4096, 8912.

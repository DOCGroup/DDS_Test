               Generating builds with MPC
               
Check out the MPC module from the SubVersion repository. It's
location is

https://svn.dre.vanaderbilt.edu/DOC/MPC

Move the contents of the 'trunk' directory up to the level of
the 'trunk' directory, and delete it. Set $MPC_ROOT in your
environment to the path of this directory. If you have ACE+TAO
installed and want to build any of the things in DDS_TEST that
require them (most builds except the OpenSplice- and RTI DDS-linked
versions of DEEP), then, from the directory
of this README file, find MPC/config/MPC.cfg and copy it to
$MPC_ROOT/config.

From this directory, type

$MPC_ROOT/mwc.pl -type <type> DDSTest.mwc

where <type> is 'make' or 'vc71' or 'vc8'. This will generate
build files for everything in DDS_Test, much of which requires
ACE+TAO to build. To build just the DEEP framework, type

cd DEEP
$MPC_ROOT/mwc.pl -type <type> -include ../MPC/config

In the DEEP directory, the file DEEP.mpc contains a project
for each DDS implementation. If you don't have all these
implementation installed, make a backup copy of DEEP.mpc
and remove the appropriate projects from the working
copy.

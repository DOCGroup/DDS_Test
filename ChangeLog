          New files, a better breakdown of functionality
          that provides every combination of lib vs
          executable and with/without typesupport processing.

        * DEEP\DEEP.mpc:

          New file, a combination of the 3 similarly named
          files below, which have been removed. Work on
          building DEEP linked to TAO DDS is not yet
          complete, requiring either listener support in
          DEEP or waitset support in TAO DDS.

        * MPC\config\ndds.mpb:
        * MPC\config\splice.mpb:

          Removed these files, they are replaced by the
          corresponding *lib.mpb new files.

        * DEEP/VERSION

        Added this file to keep track of what version of OpenSplice/RTI we
        are using.

        * DDEP/VendorSpecificIssues.html:
        
          New document, enumerating the issues that require application
          code to differ from one DDS implementation to another,
          listing the behavior of each vendor on each issue, and
          describing how each issue does or does not relate to
          spec compliance.

          Added '-namespace' to the command line of rtiddsgen in the
          MPC base project file, and put back the scoped name passed
          to several macros in the framework source files.

          Removed 'impl/' from some includes. Now that there are
          such directories for each vendor, some of these includes
          were incorrect, but they will all work without the
          prefix in any case since the local directory is
          searched first, which is what we want.

          Removed these files, they are generated and shouldn't
          be in the repository.

        * DEEP/DEEP.mpc

          Removed this file, since it isn't always the same
          file, but copied from one of the 3 vendor-specific
          MPC files below.

          Documents how to build the DEEP framework using MPC.

        * MPC/config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:

          Changes to keep in synch with the updated version of

        * DEEP/DEEP.mpc.RTI:
        * DEEP/DEEP.mpc.TAO_DDS:
        * DEEP/DEEP.mpc.OSPL:

          Changes to the vendor-specific MPC files, mostly to
          ensure that all the generated files appear in the
          build file, and that they all get removed when 'clean'
          is executed.

        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/DataReaderListener.h:

          Mostly minor changes to

          - synch with newer versions of DDS implementations

          - remove code related to exception emulation and
            exception throw specs in TAO DDS- related code,
            since this stuff was all recently removed from the
            middleware itself to conform to the current OMG
            IDL C++ mapping.

          New files, a temporary design so the DEEP framework will
          compile and link with TAO DDS until the final design is
          decided upon.

          Vendor-specific MPC files, necessary since each must have
          its own vendor-specific include paths and libs to link to.
          At present, just remove the extension after the .mpc from
          the desired MPC file and generate.
          
        * DEEP/deepTypes.idl:
        
          Added necessary #pragmas for TAO DDS.
          
        * DEEP/settingsParser/impl/SettingsParserDefault_impl.cpp:
        * DEEP/settingsParser/impl/SettingsParserXerces_impl.cpp:

        * DDS/scripts/*:
          
          benchmark and terminate should now work with latency exes
          from OpenSplice, RTI DDS, and TAO DDS.

        * DDS/performance/latency/NDDS/*

          Ming's changes for NDDS latency. Should be similar to OpenSplice
          now.

        * DDS/performance/latency/TAO_DDS/*

          Hieu's changes for TAO DDS latency. Separate code base from others:
          more object oriented.

        * DDS/performance/latency/OpenSplice

          Modified some code that was different between NDDS and OpenSplice.

        * DDS/settings/test/*

          Changes were made to some of the latency test file settings. Nothing
          major.

        * DEEP/*:
        
          New directory and files, containing the framework supplied by
          the OpenSplice folks, along with a few minor mods for
          portability. The example IDL file deepTypes.idl was moved
          from the readerWriter directory to the top-level directory,
          and MPC files were added that will build the whole thing
          as-is, linking to the OpenSplice middleware lib for now.

          Modified files, including changes to IDL files to bring the various
          test IDLs into more consistency, with corresponding changes
          to hand-written test code, changes to .mpb base class MPC
          projects to get all generated files removed upon a 'make clean'
          or equivalent, some recent changes to the test framework still
          in development, and cosmetic changes to source code.

Mon Feb 26 21:58:36 UTC 2007  James Edmondson <jedmondson@gmail.com>

        * performance/latency/NDDS/latency/*
        * settings/*
        
          Added Ming's file name changes in the NDDS latency directory.
          The changes to the settings files are minor and only specify
          diff blades that are currently being used (blade33-34).

Fri Feb 23 22:52:11 UTC 2007  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * MPC/config/splice_ts_defaults.mpb:
        * MPC/config/splice.mpb:
        
          Modified these files to work with the C++ standalone mapping of
          OpenSplice, previous version worked with the C mapping. Also
          made changes so that whatever passes for 'make clean' on
          a given build platform will remove all of the 10 files
          generated by the Splice IDL compiler, with all of their
          various suffixes and prefixes.

Fri Feb 23 21:50:21 UTC 2007  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/Stats.cpp:
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/Stats.h:
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/types_registration.h:
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/stats_export.h:
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/getopt.h:
        
          Removed these files. The stats-related files were duplicates
          of those in the Stats library, the contents of the other
          files were refactored into existing files.

        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/Splice_c++_throughput.mpc:
        
          New file, which generates 3 builds: the common generated code
          in a library, and the publisher and subscriber as executables
          that share the generated code.

        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/common_config.h:
        
          Factored out write-specific and read-specific methods
          into their corresponding publisher and subscriber source
          files. Also added necessary includes for the generated
          code. Also added workarounds for clashes in macro and
          type definitions between ACE and OpenSplice.
          
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/subscriber.cpp:
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/publisher.cpp:
        
          Rearranged include files, plus cosmetic changes. Changed
          all output messages to use ACE_DEBUG or ACE_ERROR.
          
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/TPTDef.idl:
        
          Replace all bounded sequence declarations for a given
          data type with a single unbounded sequence for that type.
          Also added empty keylist pragma directives.

        * performance/latency/NDDS/latency/*

          Benchmark.pl and terminate.pl now start processes up as root
          for rt_class usage. Several bash scripts were replaced with
          perl scripts for portability. DDS environment files were added
          to aid setting up environment (especially LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
        
          OpenSplice latency code has been incorporated into the DBE. Initial
          pass at NDDS latency code (it compiles but has not been incorporated
          yet).
        
          Added new settings files for latency tests and testing on the same
          node. Functionality has been there for a long time. This was just done
          to add a template file for others to use.


Fri Feb  2 22:29:08 UTC 2007  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/TP_Packet.idl:
        
          Removed all declarations of bounded sequences, left only
          a struct containing an unbounded octet sequence, along
          with some comments about possible future changes and
          problems.

        * settings/*
        
          Added the DBE settings files currently on the blade. These provide
          default network, qos, and test settings for easy setup and
          configuration of the DBE.

        * performance/latency/*
        
          Added the latency code base to the repository. For information
          about most of these tests, see Ming. One note should be added
          concerning performance/latency/JMS. I left the jar files in the
          commit list because I saw no information in the directory for
          rebuilding the 2 jar files. Obviously, someone else is free to
          delete them, but please leave instructions for their recreation
          in that directory.

        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C/waitset/Splice_c_waitset_tp.mpc:
        
          New file, MPC project file for Splice waitset test code.

Fri Jan 12 19:25:23 UTC 2007  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * MPC/config/splice_ts_defaults.mpb:
        
          Put MPC-style 'quote' tokens around strings with an
          environment variable that contains a space.
          
        * MPC/config/splice.mpb:
        
          Fixed name of a link lib, and added a warning suppression for
          Visual Studio builds, suppresses 'unused local variable', since
          these seem to be common in Splice generated code.
          
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C/listener/dds_config_file.cpp:

          Fixed signed/unsigned mismatches, and removed #include of .cpp
          file at the bottom of some .h files.
          
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C/listener/Splice_c_listener_tp.mpc:
        
          New file, MPC build generation file for Splice publisher and 
          subscriber in this directory.

          Restored these files and their directory, they can't be
          removed until the DDS test framework is integrated with
          all test code - my mistake.

Tue Jan  9 19:54:50 UTC 2007  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * Stats/*.*:
        
          Removed this directory and its associated buid, the
          stats stuff is now contained in the Test_Framework
          library.

Tue Jan  9 19:47:14 UTC 2007  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * DDSTest.mwc:
        
          Removed the exclude of the Stats directory, which has
          been removed. Also modified the cmdline addition to
          have the correct syntax when referring to an
          environment variable.
          
        * Test_Framework/dds_config.h:
        
          Cosmetic changes.
          
        * Test_Framework/TAO_DDS_Listeners.cpp:
        
          Added guard to exclude this file from the build unless
          we are building the TAO DDS version of Test_Framework.

Tue Dec 19 19:54:15 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * Test_Framework/dds_config.h:

          Moved these files from Test_Framework/MPC (removed,
          see below) to this new path, consistent with similar
          paths in the TAO, CIAO, and DDS modules.
          
        * Test_Framework/MPC:
        
          Removed this directory, all its files were moved as
          described above.
          
        * README:
        
          New file, containing minimal info about generating builds
          for this workspace with MPC.

Mon Sep 11 23:04:53 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * Test_Framework/README:
        
          Added outstanding issue related to NDDS - the failure
          of the nddsgen script to handle #ifndef guards around IDL.
          
        * examples/TestFrameworkExamples/Simple/Simple.idl:
        
          Added comments explaining why the #ifndef guards must
          be commented out - see above item.
          
        * examples/TestFrameworkExamples/Simple/README:
        
          New file documenting the ongoing work with the test
          framework example.

Mon Sep 11 21:11:19 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * DDSTest.mwc:
        
          New MPC workspace file for the entire DDS test tree.
          
        * Test_Framework/MPC/ddstest.mpb:
        
          New file containing MPC project to be added as a
          base project for tests that link to the Test_Framework
          library.
          
        * Test_Framework/MPC/ndds.mpb:
        * Test_Framework/MPC/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
        * Test_Framework/MPC/nddsexe.mpb:

          New files containing a hierachry of MPC projects related
          to NDDS. The top-level base project is nddsexe, which is
          to be added to DDS tests using NDDS. Makefiles or Visual
          Studio projects generated for such tests will then
          execute the nddsgen script on the specified IDL file(s)
          automatically.
          
        * examples/TestFrameworkExamples/Simple/Simple.idl:

        * examples/TestFrameworkExamples/Simple/SimpleSubTAODDS.cpp:
        * examples/TestFrameworkExamples/Simple/main.cpp:
        
          New files, comprising a new examples that demonstrates the
          use of the Test Framework library. So far, the example
          includes executables for an NDDS publisher, and NDDS
          subscriber, a TAO DDS publisher and a TAO DDS subscriber,
          all using IDL and a main() in common.

        * performanace/throughput/NDDS/TP_PacketSupport.h:
        
          Removed these files, since they are generated by the
          action of the nddsgen script on TP_Packet.idl.

Fri Sep  8 22:47:01 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * Test_Framework/README:
        
          Added a list of outstanding issues, some of them

          explaining what has been done so far.

        * Test_Framework/TestBase.cpp:
        * Test_Framework/TestBase.h:

          Updated the IDL and generated files to remove the full_name
          variable to decrease network bandwidth. Also updated html writeups
          for the CS 395 assignments.

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/Quoter.idl:
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/quoter1-NDDS.html:

          Added a comment to Quoter.idl and added the CS 395 assignment #1
          writeup file.

Tue Aug 15 17:07:55 UTC 2006  Joe Hoffert  <jhoffert@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/Quoter.idl:

          Removed the long name of the stock. This is to reduce overhead
          and is not necessary for the examples.

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/Quoter_publisher.cxx:
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/withContentFilteredTopic/Quoter_publisher.cxx:

          Updated these publishers to print out updated values to the
          screen.

Tue Aug 15 09:26:16 CDT 2006  Joe Hoffert  <jhoffert@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/withDynamicFilter/*:

          Renamed cs395 subdirectory to withDynamicFilter. I'm having
          some problems getting rid of the cs395 directory so that may
          stick around for a while. However, it is a lame duck.

Mon Aug 14 14:21:01 CDT 2006  Joe Hoffert  <jhoffert@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/cs395/Quoter_sub_repub_withCond.cxx:
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/cs395/README.txt:

          Updated the output of the Quoter_sub_repub_withCond executable
          and added a README.txt file to attempt to explain what the
          executables do.

Mon Aug 14 15:30:53 CDT 2006  Joe Hoffert  <jhoffert@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/cs395/Quoter_sub_repub_withCond.cxx:

          This subscriber application now takes an optional stock symbol
          which is used to track the maximum and minimum stock values.

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/cs395/Quoter_sub_repub_withCond.cxx:
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/cs395/makefile_Quoter_i86Linux2.6gcc3.4.3:

          Added a new executable that will subscribe to stock prices and
          filter on the maximum and minimum prices dynamically using
          filter parameters. There is still some work to be done on this
          since the max and min values are for all stocks but I wanted to
          check in what I had.

Thu Aug 10 15:11:35 CDT 2006  Joe Hoffert <jhoffert@dre.vanderbilt.edu>
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/cs395/*

          Added application files for a publisher, a subscriber, and
          a subscriber that republishes filtered data. This example
          uses some of the DDS QoS features such as reliability, history,
          and durability along with content filtered topic and dynamic
          filtering. There are still some problems with the dynamic filtering
          (i.e., Quoter_subscriber_republisher crashes) but I wanted to
          check in what I had since I had accidentally deleted some source
          files previously and the blades aren't backed up.

        * Test_Framework/Test_Framework.mpc:
        * Test_Framework/test_framework_export.h:

          New files in a new directory, created for the ongoing work
          on the DDS test code framework. Stats.cpp and Stats.h are
          copied from the DDS/Stats directory. These classe will
          become part of the test framework, and the Stats directory
          will eventually be removed.

Mon Aug  7 18:03:46 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * DDS_RTWS06.pdf:

          Removed this file, it now resides on the website.

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/subscriber.cxx:

          Removed lines related the non-existent 'echo' topic.

        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TCP/Writer.cpp:

          Removed some commented out code.

        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TypeNoKeyBounded/TypeNoKeyBounded.mpc:

          Added explicit list of inline files, to eliminate the inclusion of
          non-existent template .inl files in the generated file.

Mon Aug  7 09:32:46 CDT 2006  Joe Hoffert <jhoffert@dre.vanderbilt.edu>
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/withContentFilteredTopic/Quoter_subscriber.cxx

          Added content filtered topics plus some command line arguments to
          exercise the filtering somewhat.

Fri Aug  4 22:26:21 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/common.h:

          Removed unnecessary variables and includes.

          Minor changes.

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/subscriber.cxx:

          Removed 'loan'-related code from subscriber.

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/common.h:
        * performance/throughput/NDDS/subscriber.cxx:

          More general cleanup and formatting of code, in preparation
          for refactoring.

Thu Aug  3 000:39:15 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/common.h:

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
        * performance/throughput/NDDS/nddsexe.mpb:

          New files, needed by the recently checked in
          NDDS_throughput.mpc. These files should go into another
          directory at some point, we'll have to decide where.

          Commented out unused variables, fixed signed/unsigned
          mismatch, and initialized uninitialized variables.

        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TCP/TCP.mpc:
        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TypeNoKeyBounded/TypeNoKeyBounded.mpc:

          Changed naming convention of generated projects to be
          more consistent.

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/NDDS_throughput.mpc:

          New file, generates Visual Studio projects or gnu

        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/tcp.ini

          Added this file for the example. It should have been added with
          the other files below but it was overlooked.

          Changed the transport configuration so that the publisher and
          subscriber could be on different machines. Not exactly sure why
          all the changes were needed - I essentially copied relevant
          parts from the benchmark test.

        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/*
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/*

          Added the examples directory along with the implementation examples
          for the TAO DDS and NDDS Quoter examples. The NDDS examples have
          subdirectories for content based filter and waitset/listener
          filtering.

Fri Jul  7 15:41:09 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

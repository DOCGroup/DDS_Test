        * MPC/config/splice_ts_defaults.mpb:
        * MPC/config/splice.mpb:
        
          Modified these files to work with the C++ standalone mapping of
          OpenSplice, previous version worked with the C mapping. Also
          made changes so that whatever passes for 'make clean' on
          a given build platform will remove all of the 10 files
          generated by the Splice IDL compiler, with all of their
          various suffixes and prefixes.

        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/Stats.cpp:
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/Stats.h:
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/types_registration.h:
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/stats_export.h:
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/getopt.h:
        
          Removed these files. The stats-related files were duplicates
          of those in the Stats library, the contents of the other
          files were refactored into existing files.

        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/Splice_c++_throughput.mpc:
        
          New file, which generates 3 builds: the common generated code
          in a library, and the publisher and subscriber as executables
          that share the generated code.

        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/common_config.h:
        
          Factored out write-specific and read-specific methods
          into their corresponding publisher and subscriber source
          files. Also added necessary includes for the generated
          code. Also added workarounds for clashes in macro and
          type definitions between ACE and OpenSplice.
          
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/subscriber.cpp:
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/publisher.cpp:
        
          Rearranged include files, plus cosmetic changes. Changed
          all output messages to use ACE_DEBUG or ACE_ERROR.
          
        * performance/throughput/OpenSplice/C++/TPTDef.idl:
        
          Replace all bounded sequence declarations for a given
          data type with a single unbounded sequence for that type.
          Also added empty keylist pragma directives.

          Benchmark.pl and terminate.pl now start processes up as root
          for rt_class usage. Several bash scripts were replaced with
          perl scripts for portability. DDS environment files were added
          to aid setting up environment (especially LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
        
          OpenSplice latency code has been incorporated into the DBE. Initial
          pass at NDDS latency code (it compiles but has not been incorporated
          yet).
        
          Added new settings files for latency tests and testing on the same
          node. Functionality has been there for a long time. This was just done
          to add a template file for others to use.

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/TP_Packet.idl:
        
          Removed all declarations of bounded sequences, left only
          a struct containing an unbounded octet sequence, along
          with some comments about possible future changes and
          problems.

        * settings/*
        
          Added the DBE settings files currently on the blade. These provide
          default network, qos, and test settings for easy setup and
          configuration of the DBE.

Wed Jan 31 21:11:01 UTC 2007  James Edmondson  <jedmondson@gmail.com>

        * performance/latency/*
        
          Added the latency code base to the repository. For information
          about most of these tests, see Ming. One note should be added
          concerning performance/latency/JMS. I left the jar files in the
          commit list because I saw no information in the directory for
          rebuilding the 2 jar files. Obviously, someone else is free to
          delete them, but please leave instructions for their recreation
          in that directory.

        * MPC/config/splice_ts_defaults.mpb:
        
          Put MPC-style 'quote' tokens around strings with an
          environment variable that contains a space.
          
        * MPC/config/splice.mpb:
        
          Fixed name of a link lib, and added a warning suppression for
          Visual Studio builds, suppresses 'unused local variable', since
          these seem to be common in Splice generated code.

          all test code - my mistake.

Tue Jan  9 19:54:50 UTC 2007  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * Stats/*.*:
        
          Removed this directory and its associated buid, the
          stats stuff is now contained in the Test_Framework
          library.

Tue Jan  9 19:47:14 UTC 2007  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * DDSTest.mwc:
        
          Removed the exclude of the Stats directory, which has

          be commented out - see above item.
          
        * examples/TestFrameworkExamples/Simple/README:

        * Test_Framework/MPC/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
        * Test_Framework/MPC/nddsexe.mpb:

          New files containing a hierachry of MPC projects related
          to NDDS. The top-level base project is nddsexe, which is
          to be added to DDS tests using NDDS. Makefiles or Visual
          Studio projects generated for such tests will then
          execute the nddsgen script on the specified IDL file(s)
          automatically.

          New files, comprising a new examples that demonstrates the
          use of the Test Framework library. So far, the example
          includes executables for an NDDS publisher, and NDDS
          subscriber, a TAO DDS publisher and a TAO DDS subscriber,
          all using IDL and a main() in common.

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/withContentFilteredTopic/quoter2-NDDS.html:

          Updated the IDL and generated files to remove the full_name
          variable to decrease network bandwidth. Also updated html writeups
          for the CS 395 assignments.

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/Quoter.idl:
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/quoter1-NDDS.html:

          Added a comment to Quoter.idl and added the CS 395 assignment #1
          writeup file.

Tue Aug 15 17:07:55 UTC 2006  Joe Hoffert  <jhoffert@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/Quoter.idl:

          Removed the long name of the stock. This is to reduce overhead
          and is not necessary for the examples.

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/Quoter_publisher.cxx:
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/withContentFilteredTopic/Quoter_publisher.cxx:

          Updated these publishers to print out updated values to the
          screen.

Tue Aug 15 09:26:16 CDT 2006  Joe Hoffert  <jhoffert@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/withDynamicFilter/*:

          Renamed cs395 subdirectory to withDynamicFilter. I'm having
          some problems getting rid of the cs395 directory so that may
          stick around for a while. However, it is a lame duck.

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/cs395/Quoter_sub_repub_withCond.cxx:
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/cs395/README.txt:

          Updated the output of the Quoter_sub_repub_withCond executable
          and added a README.txt file to attempt to explain what the
          executables do.

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/cs395/Quoter_sub_repub_withCond.cxx:

          This subscriber application now takes an optional stock symbol
          which is used to track the maximum and minimum stock values.

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/cs395/makefile_Quoter_i86Linux2.6gcc3.4.3:

          Added a new executable that will subscribe to stock prices and
          filter on the maximum and minimum prices dynamically using
          filter parameters. There is still some work to be done on this
          since the max and min values are for all stocks but I wanted to
          check in what I had.

Thu Aug 10 15:11:35 CDT 2006  Joe Hoffert <jhoffert@dre.vanderbilt.edu>
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/cs395/*

          Added application files for a publisher, a subscriber, and
          a subscriber that republishes filtered data. This example
          uses some of the DDS QoS features such as reliability, history,
          and durability along with content filtered topic and dynamic
          filtering. There are still some problems with the dynamic filtering
          (i.e., Quoter_subscriber_republisher crashes) but I wanted to
          check in what I had since I had accidentally deleted some source
          files previously and the blades aren't backed up.

        * Test_Framework/Test_Framework.mpc:
        * Test_Framework/test_framework_export.h:

          New files in a new directory, created for the ongoing work
          on the DDS test code framework. Stats.cpp and Stats.h are
          copied from the DDS/Stats directory. These classe will
          become part of the test framework, and the Stats directory
          will eventually be removed.

Mon Aug  7 18:03:46 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * DDS_RTWS06.pdf:

          Removed this file, it now resides on the website.

          Removed some commented out code.

        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TypeNoKeyBounded/TypeNoKeyBounded.mpc:

          Added explicit list of inline files, to eliminate the inclusion of
          non-existent template .inl files in the generated file.

          Added content filtered topics plus some command line arguments to
          exercise the filtering somewhat.

          More general cleanup and formatting of code, in preparation
          for refactoring.

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/common.h:
        * performance/throughput/NDDS/publisher.cxx:

          Removed unused stuff and generally cleaned up the rest.

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
        * performance/throughput/NDDS/nddsexe.mpb:

          New files, needed by the recently checked in
          NDDS_throughput.mpc. These files should go into another
          directory at some point, we'll have to decide where.

          Commented out unused variables, fixed signed/unsigned
          mismatch, and initialized uninitialized variables.

        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TCP/TCP.mpc:
        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TypeNoKeyBounded/TypeNoKeyBounded.mpc:

          Changed naming convention of generated projects to be
          more consistent.

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/NDDS_throughput.mpc:

          New file, generates Visual Studio projects or gnu
          makefiles for NDDS throughput test.

        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/tcp.ini

          Added this file for the example. It should have been added with
          the other files below but it was overlooked.

          Changed the transport configuration so that the publisher and
          subscriber could be on different machines. Not exactly sure why
          all the changes were needed - I essentially copied relevant
          parts from the benchmark test.

          Added the examples directory along with the implementation examples
          for the TAO DDS and NDDS Quoter examples. The NDDS examples have
          subdirectories for content based filter and waitset/listener
          filtering.

          Minor change to debug locally on a Windows machine. These
          scripts are no longer used in our actual test runs.

        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TypeNoKeyBounded/TypeNoKeyBounded.mpc:

          Removed line 'libout = .' so lib will be output to the usual
          place for ACE+TAO+DDS builds.

        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TCP/TCP.mpc:

          Added dds_config_file.{h,cpp} to the publisher project.

        * Test_Framework/Stats.cpp:
        * Test_Framework/Stats.h:
        * Test_Framework/TestBase.cpp:
        * Test_Framework/TestBase.h:
        * Test_Framework/Test_Framework.mpc:
        * Test_Framework/test_framework_export.h:
        
          New files in a new directory, created for the ongoing work
          on the DDS test code framework. Stats.cpp and Stats.h are
          copied from the DDS/Stats directory. These classe will
          become part of the test framework, and the Stats directory
          will eventually be removed.

        * DDS_RTWS06.pdf:
        
          Removed this file, it now resides on the website.
          
        * performance/throughput/NDDS/publisher.cxx:

          Added explicit list of inline files, to eliminate the inclusion of
          non-existent template .inl files in the generated file.

        * examples/NDDSQuoter/withContentFilteredTopic/Quoter_subscriber.cxx

          Added content filtered topics plus some command line arguments to
          exercise the filtering somewhat.

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/common.h:
        * performance/throughput/NDDS/subscriber.cxx:

          for refactoring.

Thu Aug  3 000:39:15 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/common.h:
        * performance/throughput/NDDS/publisher.cxx:
        
          Removed unused stuff and generally cleaned up the rest.
        
        * performance/throughput/NDDS/ndds.mpb:
        * performance/throughput/NDDS/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
        * performance/throughput/NDDS/nddsexe.mpb:
        
          New files, needed by the recently checked in
          NDDS_throughput.mpc. These files should go into another
          directory at some point, we'll have to decide where.

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/subscriber.cxx:
        
          Commented out unused variables, fixed signed/unsigned
          mismatch, and initialized uninitialized variables.
        
        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TCP/TCP.mpc:
        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TypeNoKeyBounded/TypeNoKeyBounded.mpc:

        * performance/throughput/NDDS/NDDS_throughput.mpc:
        
          New file, generates Visual Studio projects or gnu
          makefiles for NDDS throughput test.

        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/Writer.cpp
        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/publisher.cpp
        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/subscriber.cpp

          Added comments for CS 395 assignment and cleaned up some of the code.

Mon Jul 31 07:18:01 CDT 2006  Joe Hoffert <jhoffert@vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/tcp.ini

          Added this file for the example. It should have been added with
          the other files below but it was overlooked.

Fri Jul 28 13:11:10 CDT 2006  Joe Hoffert <jhoffert@vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/README
        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/publisher.cpp
        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/run_test.pl
        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/subscriber.cpp

          Changed the transport configuration so that the publisher and
          subscriber could be on different machines. Not exactly sure why
          all the changes were needed - I essentially copied relevant
          parts from the benchmark test.

Fri Jul 28 11:17:01 CDT 2006  Joe Hoffert <jhoffert@vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/TAODDSQuoter/*
        * examples/NDDSQuoter/*

          Added the examples directory along with the implementation examples
          for the TAO DDS and NDDS Quoter examples. The NDDS examples have
          subdirectories for content based filter and waitset/listener
          filtering.

          Removed more unneeded files from the Splice throughput test
          directory.

        added "-sub" option to read the # of datareaders

Fri Jun  9 19:35:37 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TCP/dds_config_file.cpp:
        
          Fixed signed/unsigned mismatch warning.
          
        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TCP/run_test-1p1s.pl:
        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TCP/run_test-1p4s.pl:
        
          Minor change to debug locally on a Windows machine. These 
          scripts are no longer used in our actual test runs.
          
        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TypeNoKeyBounded/TypeNoKeyBounded.mpc:
        
          Removed line 'libout = .' so lib will be output to the usual
          place for ACE+TAO+DDS builds.
          
        * performance/throughput/TAO_DDS/TCP/TCP.mpc:
        
          Added dds_config_file.{h,cpp} to the publisher project.
